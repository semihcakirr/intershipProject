Before Scrat eats the acorn, he wants to cross to the other side of a small stream formed by the melting glaciers with three friends he met. They try to cross to the opposite bank using a fallen tree trunk over the stream, but they only have one acorn with them. They believe that when they cross the water, it will rise and prevent them from reaching the other side if they don't have the acorn with them. However, they instinctively understand that the tree trunk can only withstand the weight of two Cronopios.

If Scrat and his friends were to cross individually on the tree trunk, they could do it in 10, 12, 15, and 14 seconds, respectively. But because they have only one acorn, they can cross in pairs by sharing the acorn, and one of them needs to return to the starting point to bring the acorn back to the others. While Scrat and his friends embark on this journey, Diego observes from a distance and tries to calculate the shortest and longest times it will take for them to complete the crossings. Can you help Diego with calculating the durations?
